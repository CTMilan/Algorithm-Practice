# Algorithm-Practice

## About this Repository
This repository is a collection of algorithms I've learned over the years. This collection of algorithm projects acts as a personal library of algorithms I've learned while in post-secondary school; a library I can refer back to to refresh my memory on key concepts and fundamental algorithms. Each project is varying levels of refined as of right now and there likely exists some errors, but the core concepts of each algorithm should be apparent as I've tried to comment thoroughly.


### Utility Functions
Several utility functions are repeated throughout the repository, such as swapUtil(). While their existence is likely not always ideal or optimal, they do make reading through and comprehending the code a bit easier for me.

## About Me
Hey there! I'm a Software Engineering student, as of writing this I'm going into my third year this September and I'll soon be on the hunt for internships. In the meantime, I've been practicing what I know and pushing myself into subject areas I'm unfamiliar with. If you have any questions, helpful advice, or critiques of my work please feel free to reach out! I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and develop!
